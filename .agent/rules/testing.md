# Tests and verification

## Always test non‑trivial changes
- “For any new feature or bug fix, add or update tests and then run them.”
- "Never delete tests unless I explicitly approve; prefer fixing or skipping with a short comment explaining why.”

## Show what you checked
- “After running tests, give me a short summary: what you ran, what passed/failed, and any remaining risks in 5–10 lines.”
